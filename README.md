# **Personalized Nutrition & Diet Recommendation System**

This repository hosts the official implementation of the **Personalized Nutrition & Diet Recommendation System** that provides customized meal plans and nutritional recommendations using advanced machine learning techniques.

Created by **[Pasula Nithin]** üìß [22e55a0510@hitam.org]

## **üìå Project Overview**

This project provides a personalized nutrition experience using a **Multi-output Feedforward Neural Network** to dynamically match user health profiles with optimal dietary recommendations. It is designed to deliver real-time, adaptive meal plans and macronutrient targets based on individual physiological attributes, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

## **üìÅ Repository Structure**

* `frontend/` ‚Äì Contains the HTML5 + JavaScript frontend application with Bootstrap styling.
* `backend/` ‚Äì Contains the FastAPI backend server logic and neural network recommendation engine.
* `database/` ‚Äì Holds configuration related to MongoDB and data storage.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Installation & User Manual**

Follow the steps below to install and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   * Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NithinPasula/Healthy_Diet_and_Nutrition_Recommendation_System.git
cd Healthy_Diet_and_Nutrition_Recommendation_System
```

2. **Create a `.env` File in Backend**
   * Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

   * Create a file named `.env` with the following configuration:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017
DB_NAME=nutrition_recommender
```

3. **Return to Root Directory**
   * Navigate back to the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd ..
```

4. **Start the Application**
   * Run the containerized application using Docker Compose:
